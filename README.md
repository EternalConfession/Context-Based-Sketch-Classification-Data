# Context-Based-Sketch-Classification-Data

Data for our work: [Context Based Sketch Classification](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/files/28603466/SketchCoClass.pdf)

Each scene image has a corresponding .txt file that records the object categories and positions.

The record is in the format of: (x1, y1, x2, y2 object_name) with the top-left corner of image as the origin.

(x1, y1) is the coordinate of the top-left corner of the object bounding box, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of the right-bottom corner.
